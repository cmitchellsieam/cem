    <h3>Practice</h3>
    <p>My practice involves the use of acupuncture, tui-na (Chinese medical massage),
       Chinese herbal medicine, lifestyle advice, and dietary recommendations.
       I work in a collaborative process with my patients and their other healthcare providers,
       when needed, to develop a treatment plan that meets short and long-term health goals.</p>

    <h3>Academic</h3>
    <p>I graduated from the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SF, CA) in 1993. Since 1993,
       I have been seeing patients, teaching, and writing books,
       including <cite>On Cold Damage</cite>, a translation with commentary of the <cite>Shang Han Lun</cite>.
       Currently, I teach and serve as Executive Director at the Seattle Institute of East Asian Medicine.</p>
